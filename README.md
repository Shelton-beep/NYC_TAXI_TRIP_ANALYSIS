NYC Taxi Trip Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook, `NYC_Tax_Trip_Analysis.ipynb`, provides an in-depth analysis of New York City taxi trip data. The project explores trip patterns, fare characteristics, and passenger behavior across various time periods and locations within NYC.

Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to:

- Understand key metrics of NYC taxi operations, including trip duration, distance, fare amounts, and passenger counts.
- Identify trends and patterns based on trip timing (hourly, daily, weekly) and location (pick-up and drop-off zones).
- Provide insights that could benefit stakeholders in the NYC transport industry, such as city planners, ride-hailing companies, and policymakers.

Features and Analysis

This notebook includes the following sections:

1. Data Loading and Cleaning:
   - Loads the NYC taxi trip dataset and performs initial data cleaning to handle missing values, invalid entries, and data type conversions.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

   - Summarizes trip data, such as average trip distance, fare amount, and passenger count.
   - Analyzes trip distributions by day of the week, time of day, and month to identify peak times for taxi usage.
   - Examines patterns in pick-up and drop-off locations across NYC boroughs.

3. Trip and Fare Insights:

   - Calculates metrics like average fare per mile and fare per minute to assess fare efficiency.
   - Investigates the impact of external factors (e.g., weather or holidays) on taxi demand.
   - Visualizes key trends with charts, such as trip frequency heatmaps by location and time-based trends.

4. Geospatial Analysis:

   - Maps common pick-up and drop-off zones, highlighting high-demand areas.
   - Provides location-based insights using NYCâ€™s geospatial data for more precise mapping of trip flows.

5. Advanced Analysis (optional):
   - Investigates potential machine learning applications, such as predicting trip duration or fare amount based on trip distance, time, and pick-up/drop-off locations.

Requirements

To run this notebook, ensure the following libraries are installed:

- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
- `geopandas` and `folium` for geospatial analysis
- `scikit-learn` for machine learning models (optional)

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn geopandas folium scikit-learn
```

Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shelton-beep/NYC_TAXI_TRIP_ANALYSIS.git
   cd NYC_TAXI_TRIP_ANALYSIS
   ```

2. Download the NYC Taxi Data:

   - Obtain NYC taxi data from the [NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) Trip Record Data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page).
   - Place the dataset in the project directory.

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook in your environment:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Run the cells sequentially to load the data, perform cleaning, conduct analysis, and generate visualizations.

Insights and Applications

This project offers several practical applications:

- Operational Efficiency: Identifying high-demand locations and times can help optimize resource allocation for taxi services.
- Policy Development: Insights on fare efficiency and demand patterns may guide city policies related to transportation and congestion pricing.
- Future Development:
  - Further analysis of ride-sharing trends or seasonal variations in taxi demand.
  - Integration with external data sources (e.g., weather or events) to enhance predictive models.
  - Application of machine learning algorithms to predict trip duration or fare amount more accurately.

Conclusion

The `NYC_Tax_Trip_Analysis.ipynb` notebook provides a comprehensive look at NYC taxi operations, enabling deeper understanding and informed decision-making for stakeholders in the transportation industry. By examining trip data at a granular level, this analysis reveals patterns and insights that could benefit both service providers and policy advocates.
